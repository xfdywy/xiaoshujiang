## (LEGACY) About  free internet connection 

when need

>  source /data/ss_start

when don't need

> source /data/ss_stop

you can verify the connection by typing:

> curl http://httpbin.org/ip

If it gives you something like

> {
>   "origin": "218.249.50.68"
> }

it means you are not surfing on the internet  freely

something like,means the freedom

>  {
>   "origin": "54.88.4.56"
> }
