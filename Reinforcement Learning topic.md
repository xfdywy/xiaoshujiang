 # general framework
 There are many challeng problems in RL. They can be categorized in terms of different aspects
 
 ## From Algorithm 
> 1. Value function based
>  >  - policy iteration(policy evaluation)
>  >  - value iteration(Q-learing)
>  2. Policy funciton basd
>  > - reinforce algorithm
> 3. Actor Critic

## From Learning Process

 >  1. Data collection
 >	 >  - 1
 >	 >  - 2
 >  2. Data selection
 >  3. Data utilization
